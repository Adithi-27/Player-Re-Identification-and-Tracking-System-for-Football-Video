# Player Re-Identification and Tracking System for Football Video
This project implements a robust computer vision pipeline for detecting, tracking, and re-identifying football players in a video. By leveraging the YOLOv11 model for object detection, DeepSORT for real-time tracking, and ResNet-based appearance features, the system assigns consistent player IDs—even when players exit and re-enter the frame. The pipeline is built for short videos, such as a 15-second football clip, but the approach is scalable to longer durations and larger scenes.

At the core of the system is a custom re-identification module that uses multiple cues: cosine similarity of appearance features (from ResNet50), perceptual similarity via LPIPS, and spatial matching using IoU. This multi-cue strategy improves the accuracy of ID assignment and ensures players are recognized consistently across frames. Additionally, it includes a trajectory-aware fallback to handle occlusions and missed detections, reducing ID switches.

The system also performs post-tracking analytics to evaluate and visualize results. It generates heatmaps showing player presence density and plots movement trajectories over time. To assess appearance consistency of each player’s track, it computes LPIPS and FID metrics, offering both perceptual and statistical measures of re-ID quality. These evaluations help debug re-identification errors and assess robustness of the tracker.

The implementation is modular and readable, with classes for configuration, feature extraction, similarity metrics, re-identification, and tracking. The code is ready for extension and tuning—for example, replacing the base detector with another YOLO version or integrating pose estimation modules. The output includes an annotated video (`output.mp4`), visual summaries (`heatmap.png`, `trajectories.png`), and printed similarity metrics for each player.

To get started, install the required dependencies (`lpips`, `ultralytics`, and `deep_sort_realtime`) and provide a video and trained YOLOv11 weights. The project is ideal for researchers and students working on player analytics, re-identification in sports, or vision-based behavior analysis.
